# Dell-Poweredge-13th-Gen-manual-fan-control
Manually quiet down those super loud fans on a Dell Poweredge server.
I have this Dell Poweredge r730xd fully options loaded as a guinea pig server. Does anybody need full specs and included options?
Keep these notes and scripts public so that others may consume this project data.
I need help from other develpoers too.. .
Develop a script or binary to automate fan control according to current temps, or load.
Result in a machine that quieter than the Dell iDRAC defaults. Can be finely tuned to where extra airflow is needed as oppesed to iDrac default of of cranking every turbine to it's maximum rpm/noise.
Linux or Microsoft compatable for sure. Maybe even crossplatform type of app? I dont know how to create that.
Mine is now quiet enough and coolenogh to use as a daily driver. I can still hear a wall clock ticking louder than my r730xd.
